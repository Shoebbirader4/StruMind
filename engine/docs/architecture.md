# Engine Architecture

## Overview
This engine unifies 3D modeling, BIM, analysis, design, and detailing for all types of structures, inspired by Tekla, ETABS, and STAAD.Pro.

## Core Modules
- **Geometry/Modeling Kernel**: Parametric 3D objects, physical and analytical models, mapping between them.
- **Element Library**: Beams, columns, plates, shells, solids, connections, etc.
- **Analysis Engine**: FEM solver (static, dynamic, nonlinear, staged construction, etc.)
- **Design Engine**: Code checks for steel, concrete, composite, timber, etc.
- **Detailing Engine**: Connection library, drawing generation, rebar/bolt/weld detailing.
- **BIM/Interoperability**: IFC, DWG, DXF import/export, model data management.
- **API**: Python scripting and automation.
- **GUI/Visualization**: Qt-based GUI, OpenGL/SceneGraph 3D rendering (future).

## Data Flow
1. **Modeling**: User creates a physical model (geometry, materials, fabrication details).
2. **Mapping**: Physical model is mapped to an analytical model for analysis.
3. **Analysis**: FEM solver runs static/dynamic/nonlinear analysis.
4. **Design**: Design engine checks code compliance and optimizes sections.
5. **Detailing**: Detailing engine generates fabrication/assembly drawings and connection details.
6. **BIM/Export**: Model is exported to IFC or other formats for interoperability.

## Extensibility
- Modular design allows for easy addition of new element types, analysis methods, design codes, and export formats.
- Python API enables scripting and automation.
- C++ core and Qt GUI planned for high performance and advanced visualization.
