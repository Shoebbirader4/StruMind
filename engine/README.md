# Structural Engineering Engine

A next-generation open structural engineering engine combining the capabilities of Tekla (3D modeling, detailing, BIM), ETABS (building analysis/design), and STAAD.Pro (general structural analysis/design).

## Vision
- Unified platform for 3D modeling, BIM, analysis, design, detailing, and interoperability.
- Support for buildings, bridges, towers, industrial plants, and more.
- Modular, extensible, and high-performance (Python + C++ core).

## Architecture
- **core/**: Geometry, elements, analysis, design, detailing, BIM, API, utilities
- **gui/**: Qt-based graphical user interface (future)
- **visualization/**: 3D rendering (OpenGL/SceneGraph, future)
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests
- **examples/**: Example scripts and workflows
- **docs/**: Documentation

## Development Phases
1. Core modeling and analysis (Python prototype)
2. Advanced analysis and design (dynamic, nonlinear, code checks)
3. Detailing and BIM (connections, drawings, IFC)
4. Specialized structures and optimization (bridges, towers, etc.)

## Getting Started
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install numpy`
- (Future) C++/Qt/OpenGL for high-performance and GUI
